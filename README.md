# wyBinUpdater
Compiler and updater for various applications

## Instructions
- Create a ssh key (use `ssh-keygen` in a console) on the host computer
  - You can skip this step if you already have a generated ssh key
- Copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub`, this is located in `C:\Users\USER\.ssh`
- Connect to the wyBin server and go to `~/.ssh`
- Check if the file `authorized_keys` exists, if it doesn't create it (`touch authorized_keys`)
- Add the contents of the `id_rsa.pub` you copied earlier to the `authorized_keys` file
  - Make sure that ssh keys are all on separate lines

You should now be able to connect to the wyBin server and transfer files to it.

## Changing entries
If you need to change the application entries, you can easily do so without having to recompile. There is a file called `update-items.json` which holds all the applications that are configured by default. You can add, delete or change an entry to your needs and it'll load them in.
